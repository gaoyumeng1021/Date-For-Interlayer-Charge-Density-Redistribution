# Date-For-Interlayer-Charge-Density-Redistribution
This compressed archive contains three parts，each of which corresponds to Figures 2, 4 and 5 in our work titled "Origins of different charge-density redistributions at the interlayer region of transition-metal dichalcogenides."

FIG. 2: Crystal structure (POSCAR) and plane-averaged electron density redistribution (PLANAR_AVERAGE.dat) of T and H phases bulk TiS₂;

FIG. 4: Crystal structure (POSCAR) and plane-averaged electron density redistribution (PLANAR_AVERAGE.dat) of T and H phases bulk NbS₂;

FIG. 5: Crystal structure (POSCAR) and plane-averaged electron density redistribution (PLANAR_AVERAGE.dat) of T phase bulk MoS₂.
